 Header Coding Challenge

## Introduction

I completed this challenge to test my CSS skills. The task was to implement the header according to the provided designs. The header should contain navigation links that target the paths: "/", "/products", "/documentation", and "/pricing". Additionally, I had to adjust the existing "Open Dashboard" link to match the designs.

## Approach

To achieve this, I edited the pages/App.js file in the repository. I used an external CSS sheet, but alternatives like inline styles could also be used.

The project is primarily in Javascript, but the challenge file was in JSX format. 

I was unable to find the original logo so I used another logo as replacement. 

## Solution and Implementation

The solution I provided for this task may not be the cleanest, but it was sufficient for the challenge.

## Conclusion

Overall, I found this challenge enjoyable and a great opportunity to showcase my coding abilities in CSS.
